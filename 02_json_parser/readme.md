# Write Your Own JSON Parser
Challenge 2 - Write Your Own JSON Parser.

Parsing is often broken up into two stages: lexical analysis and syntactic analysis. Lexical analysis is the process of dividing a sequence of characters into meaningful chunks, called tokens. Syntactic analysis (which is also sometimes referred to as parsing) is the process of analysing the list of tokens to match it to a formal grammar.

# Description
The goal is to parse a valid simple JSON object and an invalid JSON file and correctly report which is which. 

# Usage
Use files from /tests for testing.
To use the program:

```
node parser.js [testFilename]
```
